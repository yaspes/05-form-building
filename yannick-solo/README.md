# Form Building

**Author**: Yannick Aspesberro 
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application has a form that lets the user create a article. Everytime a change gets made in the form, the application updates a live preview below the form so the user can see the changes being applied. 

## Getting Started
For a user to run this application on their machine, they can navigate to the site using a url if a live-server has been setup.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars and live-server.

## Change Log

Wrote the function that checks if local storage exists, if it doesn't, then pull the data from the file, and if it exists, grab it from local storage and render it to the HTML.
Got the function up and running, no bugs/errors in the console. (Didn't run properly until we tried it on live server.)
